_Build an application with GitHub Copilot agent mode in less than an hour._

## Welcome

People love how GitHub Copilot helps them write code faster and with fewer errors.
But what if Copilot could create a full-stack application from natural-language requirements?
In this exercise, you‚Äôll prompt **Copilot agent mode** to create a complete application.

- **Who is this for:** Intermediate developers familiar with Copilot, basic GitHub, and basic web dev  
- **What you‚Äôll learn:** How to use Copilot agent mode for application development  
- **What you‚Äôll build:** A fitness app as a high-school gym teacher  
- **How long:** < 1 hour

### You will:

1. Start a preconfigured dev environment for a full-stack app.
2. Open **Copilot Chat**, switch to the **Edit** tab, and choose **Agent mode**.
3. Try generating the app with **GPT-4o**.
4. Try other models to compare output.

## How to start this exercise

1. **Copy the exercise** (opens in a new tab):  
   <a id="copy-exercise" href="https://github.com/Arcweld1/skills-build-applications-w-copilot-agent-mode/generate">
     <img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/üì†_Copy_Exercise-AAAAAA" height="25"/>
   </a>

2. In the new tab, most fields auto-fill.
   - For **Owner**, choose your personal account or an org.
   - We recommend a **public** repo; private repos use [Actions minutes](https://docs.github.com/en/billing/managing-billing-for-github-actions/about-billing-for-github-actions).
   - Click **Create repository**.

3. After creation (‚âà20s), wait for prep and button updates (you may need to refresh):
   - **Copy Exercise** becomes disabled (gray).
   - **Start Exercise** becomes enabled (green).

4. **Start the exercise:**  
   <a id="start-exercise" href="[def]">
     <img src="[def2]" height="25"/>
   </a>

> ‚ùï **Note:** The **Start Exercise** button appears after copying. Refresh if you don‚Äôt see it.
